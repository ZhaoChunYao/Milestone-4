Refinements from previous milestones: 

1. rewrite haikus that were too straight forward 

2. The M2 haikus emphasize the gap between groups, but I found it to be a bad idea 
-- all elderly people suffers from worsen health conditions, just in different extent and in different aspects.
Plus, the bar chart visualizations already emphasize the gap in visual contrast, so my haiku should add something complementary.
Thus, instead of directly portraying the gap between groups, the new haikus focus on conveying the suffering of both groups, 
while portray the different attributes of their sufferings by the way

3. break down health disparity to specific questions, together with added bar chart visualizations

4. The current visualizations are already quite long and quite a lot. I will implement the interactive continuous plot in next milestone if I have time.
